# Edge Device Optimization in AMPTALK

This document provides an overview of AMPTALK's edge optimization features, specifically designed for deploying Whisper-based transcription models on resource-constrained devices.

## Overview

AMPTALK includes a comprehensive set of optimization techniques that enable efficient deployment of large language models (such as Whisper) on edge devices with limited computational resources. These optimizations significantly reduce model size, memory footprint, and inference time while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

## Optimization Techniques

AMPTALK provides the following optimization techniques for edge deployment:

### ONNX Conversion

[ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)](https://onnx.ai/) is an open format for representing machine learning models. Converting Whisper models to ONNX format provides several benefits:

- **Framework independence**: Models can run across different frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)
- **Runtime optimizations**: Access to specialized runtimes like ONNX Runtime with hardware-specific optimizations
- **Graph-level optimizations**: Operator fusion, constant folding, and other graph optimizations

### Decoder with Key-Value Caching

Our implementation supports several decoder approaches:

1. **Basic Decoder**: A standard decoder implementation without key-value caching.
2. **Decoder with KV Caching**: An optimized decoder that implements key-value caching for significantly faster autoregressive generation.
3. **All-in-One Model**: A complete model that combines encoder, decoder, and beam search logic into a single optimized ONNX model.

Key-Value caching provides substantial performance improvements for autoregressive decoding by reusing computation from previous decoding steps. This is particularly important for Whisper's decoder, which generates text tokens sequentially.

### All-in-One Models

The all-in-one model approach combines the encoder, decoder, beam search, and sometimes even pre/post-processing into a single optimized ONNX model. This provides several advantages:

- **Simplified Deployment**: A single model file instead of separate encoder and decoder models
- **Optimized Cross-Component Interactions**: Fusion of operations across encoder-decoder boundary
- **End-to-End Optimization**: Entire inference pipeline is optimized as a whole
- **Reduced Memory Overhead**: Reduced intermediate data transfers between components

All-in-one models are created using Microsoft's Olive tool or Hugging Face's Optimum library, with specialized optimizations for speech models.

### Quantization

Quantization reduces the precision of model weights and activations, significantly reducing model size and improving inference speed:

- **INT8 Quantization**: Reduces precision from 32-bit to 8-bit integers (up to 4x smaller)
- **FP16 Quantization**: Reduces precision from 32-bit to 16-bit floating point (up to 2x smaller)

### Operator Fusion

Operator fusion combines multiple operations into a single optimized operation, reducing memory transfers and improving computational efficiency.

### Knowledge Distillation

AMPTALK can leverage pre-distilled models (like Distil-Whisper) that are smaller and faster versions of the original models while maintaining most of the accuracy.

## Optimization Levels

AMPTALK provides multiple optimization levels to balance accuracy, size, and speed:

| Level | Techniques | Size Reduction | Speed Improvement | Accuracy Impact |
|-------|------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| NONE | None | 0% | 0% | None |
| BASIC | ONNX Conversion | ~10-20% | ~10-30% | Negligible |
| MEDIUM | ONNX + FP16 Quantization | ~40-50% | ~30-50% | Low |
| HIGH | ONNX + INT8 Quantization + Operator Fusion | ~60-70% | ~50-70% | Moderate |
| EXTREME | ONNX + INT8 + Fusion + Distillation | ~80-90% | ~70-90% | Significant |

## Target Devices

The optimization pipeline can target various devices:

- **CPU**: General-purpose optimization for CPUs
- **GPU**: Optimization for NVIDIA/AMD GPUs
- **NPU**: Neural Processing Units (e.g., Apple Neural Engine)
- **Mobile**: Optimization for mobile devices
- **Browser**: Optimization for WebAssembly/WebGL runtime
- **Embedded**: Optimization for small embedded systems

## Usage

### Integrating with TranscriptionAgent

The `TranscriptionAgent` class supports optimized models via the `WhisperOptimized` model type:

```python
from src.agents.transcription_agent import TranscriptionAgent, ModelType, WhisperModelSize

# Create a transcription agent with edge optimization
agent = TranscriptionAgent(
    agent_id="transcription_agent",
    model_size=WhisperModelSize.TINY,
    model_type=ModelType.WHISPER_OPTIMIZED,
    optimization_level="MEDIUM",
    target_device="cpu"
)

# Use the agent as normal
result = await agent.process_message(message)
```

### Using All-in-One Models with TranscriptionAgent

For maximum performance, you can use the all-in-one model type:

```python
from src.agents.transcription_agent import TranscriptionAgent, ModelType, WhisperModelSize

# Create a transcription agent with an all-in-one optimized model
agent = TranscriptionAgent(
    agent_id="transcription_agent",
    model_size=WhisperModelSize.TINY,
    model_type=ModelType.WHISPER_OPTIMIZED_ALL_IN_ONE,  # Use the all-in-one model
    optimization_level="MEDIUM",
    target_device="cpu"
)

# Use the agent as normal
result = await agent.process_message(message)
```

### Direct Access to Complete ONNX Models

For advanced use cases, you can directly access both decoder types:

```python
from src.core.utils.edge_optimization import (
    EdgeOptimizer, OptimizationLevel, DeviceTarget
)

# Create optimizer
optimizer = EdgeOptimizer(
    optimization_level=OptimizationLevel.MEDIUM,
    target_device=DeviceTarget.CPU,
    cache_dir="./models/optimized"
)

# Option 1: Get separate encoder/decoder models with KV caching
result = optimizer.optimize_whisper(
    model_size="tiny",
    language="en",
    all_in_one=False  # Default - separate encoder/decoder
)

# Option 2: Create an all-in-one model
result = optimizer.optimize_whisper(
    model_size="tiny",
    language="en",
    all_in_one=True  # Create an all-in-one model
)

# Get the model paths
model_path = result["model_path"]
```

### Example Script with All-in-One Support

The example script now supports both approaches:

```bash
# Run with separate encoder/decoder models (default)
python examples/edge_optimization_demo.py --model-size tiny --optimization-level MEDIUM

# Run with all-in-one model
python examples/edge_optimization_demo.py --model-size tiny --optimization-level MEDIUM --all-in-one
```

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies

The edge optimization features require the following dependencies:

- `onnx`: For model conversion to ONNX format
- `onnxruntime`: For optimized inference
- `optimum`: For HuggingFace model optimization
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `torch`: For PyTorch model handling

For all-in-one models, you may need additional dependencies:
- `onnxruntime-extensions`: For specialized ONNX operators used in all-in-one models
- `optimum-cli`: Command-line tool for creating all-in-one models

### Limitations

The following limitations should be noted:

1. **Full ONNX Decoding**: The current implementation supports encoder-only inference with ONNX. Full autoregressive decoding with ONNX requires additional work.

2. **Mobile Deployment**: For mobile deployment, additional steps are needed to integrate with mobile frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or Core ML.

3. **INT4 Quantization**: Extreme quantization to INT4 is currently not supported but planned for future releases.

The all-in-one model approach has the following considerations:
1. **External Libraries**: May require additional dependencies such as `onnxruntime-extensions`
2. **Larger Deployment Size**: The combined model may be larger, which could be an issue for very constrained environments
3. **Model-Specific Optimizations**: Not all optimization techniques apply equally to all model sizes

## Future Work

Planned enhancements for edge optimization include:

1. **Complete ONNX Decoding**: Implement full decoder support for end-to-end ONNX inference âœ… Completed
2. **Mobile Framework Export**: Direct export to TensorFlow Lite and Core ML
3. **INT4 Quantization**: Support for ultra-low precision quantization
4. **Pruning**: Structured and unstructured pruning techniques
5. **Speculative Decoding**: Implementing efficient speculative decoding for faster inference
