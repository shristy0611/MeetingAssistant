As the AI Project Manager, I'm excited to present a comprehensive overview of our cutting-edge, fully offline, multi-agent AI framework designed for meeting transcription and analysis. This project aims to revolutionize how organizations handle meetings by ensuring data privacy, offering advanced features, and supporting both English and Japanese languages.

**Project Overview**

Our goal is to develop an end-to-end, locally deployable AI system that transcribes and analyzes both online and face-to-face meetings. By leveraging state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI models and techniques, we aim to provide real-time insights, enhance productivity, and maintain strict data privacy by eliminating the need for internet connectivity.

**Key Features**

1. **Real-Time Transcription**: Accurately transcribe meetings in real-time, supporting both English and Japanese languages.

2. **Audio Intelligence**:
   - **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of meeting content.
   - **Topic Detection**: Identify and extract key topics discussed.
   - **Intent Recognition**: Understand the intentions behind statements.
   - **Entity Detection**: Recognize and extract key entities such as names, dates, and organizations.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of discussions.

3. **Pain Point Detection**: Identify areas of concern or dissatisfaction in real-time and suggest actionable solutions.

4. **Diarization**: Differentiate between speakers to attribute statements accurately.

5. **Smart Formatting**: Enhance readability by applying appropriate punctuation, capitalization, and formatting.

6. **Profanity Filtering**: Detect and filter out inappropriate language to maintain professionalism.

**System Architecture**

The system is built upon a multi-agent framework, where each agent specializes in a specific task:

- **Transcription Agent**: Utilizes advanced speech recognition models to transcribe audio input.

- **NLP Agent**: Processes transcriptions to perform summarization, topic detection, intent recognition, and entity detection.

- **Sentiment Analysis Agent**: Evaluates the emotional tone of the conversation.

- **Pain Point Detection Agent**: Analyzes sentiments and context to identify and address issues.

- **Diarization Agent**: Segments audio to distinguish between different speakers.

- **Formatting Agent**: Applies smart formatting and filters profanity.

     - Implement features for real-time interaction and feedback.
     - Ensure accessibility and user-friendliness.

5. **Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance**
   - **Objective**: Deploy the system on edge devices using Docker containers and establish maintenance protocols.
   - **Duration**: 4 weeks
   - **Activities**:
     - Set up Docker environments for deployment.
     - Deploy the system on target edge devices.
     - Establish monitoring and maintenance procedures.

**Technological Stack**

- **Programming Languages**: Python for backend development; JavaScript (React) for frontend development.

- **AI Frameworks**: TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development.

- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization; optimized for edge devices.

- **Data Storage**: SQLite for lightweight, local data storage.

**Security and Privacy Measures**

- **Data Encryption**: Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.

- **Access Control**: Role-based access control to restrict system access.

- **Audit Logging**: Maintain logs of all system activities for auditing purposes.

**Performance Metrics**

To ensure the system meets its objectives, we will monitor the following performance metrics:

- **Transcription Accuracy**: Aim for a Word Error Rate (WER) below 5%. WER is calculated as:

  \[ \text{WER} = \frac{S + D + I}{N} \]

  where \( S \) is the number of substitutions, \( D \) is deletions, \( I \) is insertions, and \( N \) is the total number of words in the reference. citeturn0search20

- **Processing Latency**: Ensure end-to-end processing time does not exceed 500 milliseconds to maintain real-time responsiveness.

- **Sentiment and Pain Point Detection**: Target precision and recall rates above 90% for accurate identification of sentiments and issues.

- **System Reliability**: Achieve uptime of 99.9%, minimizing downtime and ensuring consistent performance.

**Project Timeline**

The project is structured into five key phases, spanning a total of 27 weeks:

1. **Research and Planning**: 4 weeks
