# Speech Recognition Models Research

## OpenAI's Whisper Model Analysis

### Overview

OpenAI's Whisper is an open-source, multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. This research document examines its suitability for the AMPTALK project, focusing on offline deployment capabilities and multilingual support.

### Architecture

Whisper uses an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture:
- **Encoder**: Processes the audio input through a convolutional neural network followed by a Transformer encoder
- **Decoder**: Transformer decoder that generates text tokens from the encoded audio representations

The model comes in various sizes:
- Tiny: 39M parameters
- Base: 74M parameters
- Small: 244M parameters
- Medium: 769M parameters
- Large: 1.5B parameters

For edge deployment, the Tiny and Base variants offer the best balance of performance and resource consumption.

### Multilingual Capabilities

Whisper has demonstrated strong multilingual capabilities, particularly relevant for our English and Japanese requirements:
- Supports 96 languages including English and Japanese
- Shows robust performance across accents, background noise, and technical language
- Zero-shot transfer learning capabilities enable adaptation to specialized domains

### Offline Deployment Considerations

For fully offline deployment on edge devices, several factors need consideration:

1. **Model Size and Quantization**:
   - Whisper Base (74M) is approximately 300MB in its default FP32 format
   - 8-bit quantization can reduce size by 75% to approximately 75MB
   - 4-bit quantization can further reduce size but with potential accuracy tradeoffs

2. **Inference Speed**:
   - Real-time transcription requires efficient inference
   - Base model on CPU: ~0.5x real-time processing on modern hardware
   - GPU acceleration: Can achieve 2-5x real-time processing even on mobile GPUs
   - Optimization frameworks like ONNX Runtime can improve inference speed

3. **Resource Requirements**:
   - Memory: Minimum 1GB RAM for Base model with optimizations
   - Storage: 75-300MB depending on quantization level
   - CPU: Minimum quad-core for reasonable performance
   - Optional GPU: Significant performance enhancement with even low-end GPUs

### Accuracy Benchmarks

Preliminary research shows the following Word Error Rates (WER) for Whisper models:

| Model Size | English WER | Japanese WER |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Tiny       | 10.1%       | 15.4%        |
| Base       | 8.2%        | 12.8%        |
| Small      | 6.5%        | 9.9%         |
| Medium     | 5.1%        | 8.5%         |
| Large      | 4.2%        | 7.8%         |

Note: These are general benchmarks and will vary based on audio quality, domain specificity, and speech patterns.

### Fine-tuning Strategy

To enhance performance for meeting transcription specifically:

1. **Domain Adaptation**:
   - Fine-tune with meeting audio/transcript pairs
   - Focus on business terminology and conversational patterns
   - Implement vocabulary boosting for domain-specific terms

2. **Acoustic Adaptation**:
   - Adapt to common meeting audio characteristics (conference rooms, background noise)
   - Optimize for multiple speaker scenarios
   - Adjust for varying microphone qualities and distances

3. **Language-Specific Optimization**:
   - Separate fine-tuning for English and Japanese language models
   - Optimize tokenization for Japanese language specifics
   - Address cultural and linguistic nuances in business settings

### Optimization Techniques

Several techniques can enhance performance on edge devices:

1. **Knowledge Distillation**:
   - Train smaller models to mimic the behavior of larger models
   - Can achieve comparable accuracy with significantly reduced size

2. **Pruning**:
   - Remove redundant neurons and connections
   - Iterative pruning with fine-tuning can preserve most of the accuracy

3. **Adaptive Processing**:
   - Dynamic adjustment of model precision based on input complexity
   - Reserve full processing power for challenging audio segments

4. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process audio in small batches to optimize memory usage
   - Implement sliding window approach for real-time transcription

### Integration with Multi-Agent Framework

Whisper can be effectively integrated into our multi-agent framework:

1. **Preprocessing Agent**:
   - Audio segmentation and noise reduction
   - Speaker diarization preprocessing

2. **Core Transcription Agent**:
   - Main Whisper model implementation
   - Language detection and model switching

3. **Post-processing Agent**:
   - Text normalization and formatting
   - Punctuation and capitalization enhancement

### Research Next Steps

1. Deploy and benchmark Whisper models on target edge devices
2. Test performance with real meeting recordings in both English and Japanese
3. Experiment with various optimization techniques and measure their impact
4. Develop and test fine-tuning approaches with domain-specific data
5. Create integration prototypes with other system components

## Alternative Models Consideration

While Whisper is our primary candidate, these alternatives merit investigation:

1. **Mozilla DeepSpeech**:
   - Fully open-source
   - Smaller model size, but less multilingual capability

2. **Silero Models**:
   - Optimized for edge devices
   - Strong performance in specific languages, but less versatile

3. **Wav2Vec 2.0**:
   - Strong performance in low-resource settings
   - Self-supervised learning capabilities

## Conclusion

OpenAI's Whisper presents a compelling option for our fully offline, multilingual meeting transcription system. The Base or Small variants, with appropriate optimizations, can likely meet our requirements for edge deployment while maintaining acceptable accuracy in both English and Japanese.
