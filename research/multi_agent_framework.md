# Multi-Agent Framework Architecture Research

## Introduction

The AMPTALK system requires a sophisticated multi-agent architecture to handle the complex tasks of meeting transcription, analysis, and insight generation in a fully offline environment. This document explores the research and design considerations for implementing an effective multi-agent framework that can operate within the constraints of edge devices.

## Multi-Agent System Fundamentals

### Definition and Principles

A multi-agent system (MAS) consists of multiple interacting intelligent agents within an environment. For AMPTALK, these agents will collaborate to process meeting audio, transcribe speech, analyze content, and generate insights without requiring internet connectivity.

Key principles that guide our research:

1. **Decentralization**: Distribute tasks among specialized agents to enhance modularity and maintainability
2. **Autonomy**: Each agent should operate independently within its domain
3. **Coordination**: Enable effective communication and collaboration between agents
4. **Adaptability**: Allow agents to adjust behavior based on input complexity and resource availability
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize for edge deployment with limited computational resources

## Proposed Agent Architecture

Based on the requirements outlined in the project documentation, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with the following components:

### 1. Core Agents

#### Audio Processing Agent
- **Responsibilities**: Audio capture, noise reduction, speaker segmentation
- **Input**: Raw audio stream
- **Output**: Cleaned audio segments with speaker identification markers
- **Key Technologies**: Signal processing libraries, voice activity detection

#### Transcription Agent
- **Responsibilities**: Convert audio to text using optimized Whisper models
- **Input**: Processed audio segments
- **Output**: Raw transcription with speaker attribution
- **Key Technologies**: OpenAI Whisper (optimized), language detection

#### NLP Processing Agent
- **Responsibilities**: Text analysis, entity extraction, topic modeling
- **Input**: Raw transcription
- **Output**: Enriched transcript with entities, topics, and semantic structure
- **Key Technologies**: Spark NLP (optimized), custom NLP models

#### Sentiment Analysis Agent
- **Responsibilities**: Detect emotions, sentiment, and pain points
- **Input**: Enriched transcript with context
- **Output**: Sentiment annotations, pain point identifications
- **Key Technologies**: Custom sentiment models, emotion recognition

#### Summarization Agent
- **Responsibilities**: Generate meeting summaries, action items, key points
- **Input**: Complete analyzed transcript
- **Output**: Meeting summaries at various granularity levels
- **Key Technologies**: Extractive and abstractive summarization models

### 2. Meta Agents

#### Orchestration Agent
- **Responsibilities**: Coordinate agent activities, manage workflow, allocate resources
- **Input**: System state, resource availability, task queue
- **Output**: Task assignments, priority adjustments
- **Key Technologies**: Rule-based systems, lightweight scheduling algorithms

#### Memory Agent
- **Responsibilities**: Maintain context across meeting sessions, store and retrieve relevant information
- **Input**: Processed meeting data, contextual queries
- **Output**: Contextual information, historical references
- **Key Technologies**: Local vector database, information retrieval systems

## Inter-Agent Communication Patterns

For a resource-efficient multi-agent system, we'll investigate these communication patterns:

### 1. Message Passing Protocol

A lightweight, asynchronous message passing system with:
- **Standardized Message Format**: JSON-based structure for consistency
- **Message Prioritization**: Critical messages (e.g., transcription results) have precedence
- **Buffering Mechanisms**: Handle temporary processing delays

Example message structure:
```json
{
  "message_id": "unique_identifier",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "source_agent": "transcription_agent",
  "target_agent": "nlp_processing_agent",
  "priority": 2,
  "message_type": "transcription_result",
  "payload": {
    "transcript_segment": "text content",
    "speaker_id": "speaker_1",
    "confidence_score": 0.92,
    "segment_start_time": 65.4,
    "segment_end_time": 72.1
  }
}
```

### 2. Shared Memory Spaces

For efficiency, certain data can be shared via:
- **Read-Only Shared Spaces**: For reference data and models
- **Controlled Write Spaces**: For cumulative results like the transcript
- **Agent-Specific Private Spaces**: For intermediate processing

### 3. Event-Based Communication

A publish-subscribe pattern where:
- Agents publish events (e.g., "transcription_completed")
- Interested agents subscribe to relevant events
- Reduces direct dependencies between agents

## Resource Management Strategies

Operating on edge devices requires careful resource management:

### 1. Dynamic Resource Allocation

- **Adaptive Precision**: Scale model precision based on available resources
- **Task Prioritization**: Critical path tasks get resource priority
- **Background/Foreground Processing**: Distinguish between real-time needs and background tasks

### 2. Pipeline Optimization

- **Data Streaming**: Process data in chunks rather than waiting for complete inputs
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multi-core capabilities where appropriate
- **Cooperative Multitasking**: Agents yield resources when idle

### 3. State Management

- **Checkpointing**: Allow for recovery from interruptions
- **Incremental Processing**: Build results progressively
- **Persistence Strategy**: Efficiently save intermediate results

## Implementation Approaches

We'll research these potential implementation approaches:

### 1. Custom Lightweight Framework

Developing a tailored framework offers maximum optimization potential:
- Core agent base class with standardized interfaces
- Minimal dependencies and overhead
- Designed specifically for offline edge deployment

### 2. Adapted Existing Frameworks

Several existing frameworks could be adapted:
- **RASA**: Open-source framework with NLU capabilities
- **Ray**: Distributed computing framework with actor model
- **SPADE**: Python-based multi-agent development framework

### 3. Hybrid Approach

Combine custom components with adapted libraries:
- Custom inter-agent communication protocol
- Adapted model serving infrastructure
- Custom resource management, but standard agent definitions

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the multi-agent framework, we'll measure:

1. **Latency**: End-to-end processing time
2. **Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU, and storage requirements
3. **Scalability**: Performance with increasing meeting duration/complexity
4. **Robustness**: Ability to handle unexpected inputs or resource constraints
5. **Extensibility**: Ease of adding new agent types or capabilities

## Research Prototyping Plan

To validate our multi-agent architecture:

1. **Minimal Viable Prototype**:
   - Implement core Transcription and NLP agents
   - Test basic message passing
   - Measure resource usage and latency

2. **Integration Prototype**:
   - Add remaining core agents
   - Implement shared memory spaces
   - Test end-to-end workflow

3. **Optimization Prototype**:
   - Implement resource management strategies
   - Test dynamic scaling based on input complexity
   - Benchmark performance on target devices

## Conclusion

The multi-agent framework architecture for AMPTALK requires careful balancing of sophistication and resource efficiency. Our research suggests a hierarchical architecture with specialized agents, lightweight communication protocols, and adaptive resource management will best meet the project requirements for a fully offline, edge-deployed meeting transcription and analysis system.
