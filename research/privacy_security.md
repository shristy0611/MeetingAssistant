# Privacy and Security Research for AMPTALK

## Introduction

The AMPTALK system processes potentially sensitive meeting information, making privacy and security critical components of the architecture. This research document outlines privacy considerations, security measures, and implementation strategies for ensuring a robust and compliant offline meeting transcription system.

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Privacy Principles

The AMPTALK system is designed with privacy-by-design principles:

1. **Data Minimization**: Only process data necessary for system functionality
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Use data solely for explicitly stated purposes
3. **Storage Limitation**: Retain data only for required periods
4. **User Control**: Provide options for data management and deletion
5. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of data handling practices

### Privacy Benefits of Offline Processing

AMPTALK's fully offline architecture provides inherent privacy advantages:

- **No Data Transmission**: Information never leaves the local device
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Eliminates risks associated with cloud storage
- **Physical Control**: Data remains within the physical control of the organization
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Fewer points of potential data exposure

### Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

Several privacy-enhancing technologies will be researched for integration:

1. **Differential Privacy**:
   - Add calibrated noise to analysis outputs
   - Protect individual contributions while maintaining aggregate insights
   - Research appropriate epsilon values for different sensitivity levels

2. **Local Privacy Techniques**:
   - Implement local anonymization of personally identifiable information (PII)
   - Develop entity recognition and redaction capabilities
   - Research pseudonymization approaches for speaker identification

3. **Secure Multi-party Computation**:
   - Explore techniques for distributed computation without revealing inputs
   - Research applicability to multi-device meeting scenarios
   - Evaluate performance impact of cryptographic protocols

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

The AMPTALK system faces several potential threats:

1. **Physical Access Threats**:
   - Unauthorized access to the device
   - Theft of device containing sensitive meeting data
   - Malicious peripheral devices

2. **Software Threats**:
   - Malware targeting stored meeting data
   - Compromised dependencies in the software stack
   - Side-channel attacks against AI models

3. **User-Related Threats**:
   - Insider threats from authorized users
   - Social engineering attacks
   - Unintentional misconfigurations

### Security Controls

To address these threats, we propose a comprehensive security architecture:

#### 1. Data Protection

**Encryption at Rest**:
- AES-256 encryption for all stored meeting data
- Separate encryption for different sensitivity categories
- Secure key management with hardware security where available

**Secure Storage**:
- Isolated storage areas with restricted access
- Secure deletion capabilities
- Optional secure enclaves for highest sensitivity data

**Memory Protection**:
- Guard pages around sensitive data in memory
- Minimize plaintext data lifetime in memory
- Memory sanitization after processing

#### 2. Access Controls

**Authentication Mechanisms**:
- Multi-factor authentication options for system access
- Integration with organizational identity systems
- Biometric options for high-security environments

**Authorization Framework**:
- Role-based access control for different system functions
- Fine-grained permissions for specific meeting records
- Attribute-based access control for complex scenarios

**Audit Logging**:
- Comprehensive logs of access and operations
- Tamper-evident logging
- Privacy-preserving audit mechanisms

#### 3. Application Security

**Secure Development Practices**:
- Static and dynamic code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security testing

**Container Security**:
- Minimal attack surface container design
- Read-only file systems where possible
- Principle of least privilege for container execution

**Model Security**:
- Protection against model extraction attacks
- Adversarial example detection
- Secure model update mechanisms

## Regulatory Compliance

### Compliance Frameworks

The AMPTALK system will be designed to support compliance with:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**:
   - Data minimization and purpose limitation
   - Right to access, rectification, and erasure
   - Data protection impact assessment

2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**:
   - Protected health information safeguards
   - Technical and administrative controls
   - Audit controls and integrity requirements

3. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)/California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**:
   - Consumer rights to access and deletion
   - Opt-out capabilities
   - Service provider requirements

4. **Industry-Specific Regulations**:
   - Financial services (GLBA, PCI DSS)
   - Legal (attorney-client privilege protections)
   - Government (FedRAMP, CJIS where applicable)

### Compliance Features

To support these compliance requirements, we'll research and implement:

1. **Data Governance Tools**:
   - Data inventory and classification
   - Retention and deletion policies
   - Data lineage tracking
